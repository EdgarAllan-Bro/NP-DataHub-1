# NP-DataHub
Data Visualization/ML Platform that Assesses 
Nonprofits and Sector-Based Ecosystems

OVERVIEW

Even though there are databases that cater to donors and monitor baseline financial activity for nonprofits based on documents, there is no one resource that allows the end-user to visualize fiscal performance and examine longitudinal data for each nonprofit and an entire non-profit sector, of which there are 26 as defined by the IRS. There also isnâ€™t a sector-based platform that can produce prescriptive and predictive forecasting through algorithmic construction and other ML/AI capabilities.

Based on public IRS data, culled over eight years, we will build a platform allowing the end-user to visualize non-profit fiscal performance to help inform grantmakers, donors, and public policymakers make more accurate and efficient decisions. Essentially, this platform will be similar to the Bloomberg terminal but for nonprofits. This will be accomplished by combining public data solutions and including predictive insights and potential AI functionality. Algorithms are already created and will eventually be integrated.

In short, the tentatively named NP DataHub is a cloud-based data intelligence platform for philanthropies and nonprofits that offers algorithmic-based insights for more strategic community investment. 

Often, nonprofits have little direction in collaborating with other organizations with similar missions based on a data-specific composition and geography. Grant-making foundations have a similar problem. Both also have few pathways to combine resources through donor engagement to holistically fund or approach a societal problem, of which public data addressing these problems is more readily and publicly accessible. Instead, these processes are piece-mealed. The objective is to create a platform that links pathways and explains the findings while building on the basic historical data that can be found on other non-profit document aggregation websites.

PROJECT TIMELINE

The project is designed to be three-month explorations with three key deliverable checkpoints:

KEY DATE BENCHMARKS

SHORT-TERM OBJECTIVES

Identify one of 26 NTEE sectors within New York State, which will serve as a testing sample for algorithmic construction, platform development, and data visualization implementation. Then apply this to all NTEE codes across all states.
Establish the preliminary database foundation for the NTEE sample and associated functionality to be implemented within the V1.0 platform.
Establish the V1.0 platform with associated end-user functionality for data visualization/dashboard construction and algorithmic results.
Incorporate future NTEE sectors within the framework established by the first team of developers with a goal of including all 26 by end of summer 2024.
Begin testing phase on selected fiscal variables of individual nonprofits and associated NTEE codes and define their purpose. (What story are we trying to tell through data that will serve the public interest based on fiscal performance?) Developers can establish the quantity of algorithms with a focus on quality. 
Begin testing phase on selected fiscal variables of individual nonprofits and associated NTEE codes and define their purpose and alignment with the chosen public dataset. (What story are we trying to tell through data that will serve the public interest?) Developers can establish the quantity of algorithms with a focus on quality. This is TBD.
Finalize algorithms with an emphasis on accuracy and precision.
Incorporate findings within the chosen open-source data visualization libraries.
Construct data visualization dashboard.
Launch V1.0 of the platform for user testing and presentation.  

PROCESS REQUIREMENTS

The desired deployment focuses on the development of a web-based browser application. The most universal programming solution appears to be the most intuitive and appropriate for this project and given the data-base structure and emphasis on data intelligence gathering, this is important for current and future developments as expected iterations of this language must be compatible for upgrade purposes. The project client defers to the developers to establish this framework. 

DATA SOURCE

As noted above and given this stage of the project, any open source option can be used as the focus will be more on the sample of IRS data within a certain NTEE sector in New York State, and not the full data population. As of now, based on preliminary discussions with the developers, a streamlined MongoDB or MySQL solution is more than welcomed. Since these solutions are open source and widely accepted, there is an emphasis on making strategic decisions as future developers and iterations must understand the building blocks, so to speak, for this platform. Currently, the data-wrangling aspect of the project is completed, meaning the developers can focus on algorithmic, platform, and data visualization construction, of which the last takes priority. 

LIMITATIONS

The primary challenge is more so aesthetic as data visualization solutions often reproduce in a cumbersome fashion on some browsers. A second limitation is also identifying a Javascript-based or other UI that will offer the strongest results while also reproducing in a mobile format. Some options have been identified, but an open discussion is very much welcomed. The last limitation may be the identification of reputable data sources to connect data gathered on certain issues that can connect to the NTEE sector for algorithmic construction and insight. Before this step is taken, a larger discussion is needed about the connectivity of the public data set, the availability of data, and how this may connect to the fiscal performance data of individual nonprofits and their NTEE sector. 

ENDNOTE

The data wrangling/cleaning and methodology construction has been a two-year process, therefore, the focus of this step in the project should be on platform construction and strong choices in database structure, data visualization selection and implementation, and algorithmic construction and implementation.
